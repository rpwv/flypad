“We are Africans, we want to be represented too” words of Xavier after the first meeting of the crew on one ordinary Thursday, 5th of November, 2015 at the Hollywood hostel in Yaba College of Technology. The crew which consists Michael Aghado, Opeyemi, Chinaza Okpara, John Taiwo, Xavier Kanu and George Samuel met over and over again modifying and re-modifying ideas on how to make this dream come to life. Though they were students at that time, they were able to identify three interests in which FlypadCorp will focus on, which were – Food, Entertainment, and Technology. The unconventional company it set out to be, ideas were mandated to be simple and telling. The company started as a Business Idea Development Company, helping out startups structure their ideas and innovations, providing tools necessary for the establishment of this idea. FlypadCorp then went on developing its ideas, which were Flypad, Bridge Flour Mill, and XavezoneNG (Sluff). The company’s founders in its first two years of existence had managed to work remotely. In 2016, more hands came on deck to help bring the dream to life; they were three of them – Damilola Bello, Oba Abioye, Nicole and Ayomide (Stunt 247). In September 2016, the Potato Flour Idea was pitched as a presentation at the Bridge Programme in Lagos, and it was promised to fund. While XavezoneNG which started as a blogging site is focused on promoting upcoming artists, who have the drive to pursue this as a career, giving them the platform in which their works can get to its targeted audience. FlypadCorp plan to launch Flypad (a social networking site, first of its kind in Africa) in summer, 2018. Flypad will come with an app which will run on android, windows and IOS devices, and Padder, a real-time messaging app.
